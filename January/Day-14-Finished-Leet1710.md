# Day 14

Another slow day for the Daily push! Today, I just finished implementing the greedy solution to Leetcode 1710 (https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/)

I used lambda operators to sort the 2d array provided as an argument although it really seems like magic to me stil...I'll have to look into it over the weekend!
