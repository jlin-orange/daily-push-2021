# Day 2! 

Today, I spent a little more time practicing Leetcode. Because I didn't have enough discipline/time to work on a more difficult problem, I just implemented a little solution to...
[Leetcode 1002](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/) - Find common Characters

I did it in Java since I did this super late at night and just needed a solution!
