# Day 7

Today, I finished added a teensy bit of CSS to my website! I also uploaded a basic profile picture.
I still haven't decided what kind of information I actually want to put on my website, so that's coming up soon.
I think I'm going to aim for a compact website so people won't have to scroll a lot to find things!

**Here is a picture of the progress from today:**
