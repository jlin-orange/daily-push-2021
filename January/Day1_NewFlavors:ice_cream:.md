# Day 1 - Leetcode in 2 New Flavors!

This year, I expect to be working with 2 languages that are completely new to me at the moment!
These two languages are: C++ and Ruby

### The context for each:
* C++  - an Operating Systems course 
* Ruby - my summer internship as a Support Engineer

Just to start learning these two, I'm doing leetcode questions in each language respectively as a way to learn!
