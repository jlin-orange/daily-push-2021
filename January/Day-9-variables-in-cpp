# Day 9

Just experimented with making a few basic functions in C++ today (using VSCode).
I finally figured how to compile + run an executable through the VSCode terminal lol.

I had downloaded MinGW to get things working. Normally, I think Bowdoin would have 
students use a school machine on their own server.
